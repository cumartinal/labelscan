# LabelScan (university 3rd year project)

An Android app that can scan FDA nutrition labels and present them in a more accessible manner. Done as my 3rd year project at the University of Manchester, UK.

## General info

The original release () was how the project looked like at the date of submission. I plan to polish and improve the app, doing things like:

* Improving/rewriting the UI code and app logic
* Improve overall UX
* Adding additional planned features that did not make the cut due to time constraints
* Add testsfof future development
* And a lot of polishing!

However, I do not expect to ever have the app in a publicly releasable state anytime soon, mainly because the method for scanning the nutrition labels needs a complete rework using more complex methods

## Is there an app demo?

Yes! I will soon make publicly available the demo video produced when I originally submitted this project.
